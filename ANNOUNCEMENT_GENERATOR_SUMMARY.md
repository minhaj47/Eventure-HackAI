# AI-Powered Event Announcement Generator - Implementation Summary

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🔧 Backend Implementation
1. **New API Endpoint**: `POST /api/event/generate-announcement`
   - Location: `backend/controllers/event.controller.js`
   - Route: `backend/routes/event.routes.js`
   - Uses Smythos AI service for content generation

2. **Request Schema**:

   }
   ```

3. **Integration with Smythos**: 
   - Endpoint: `https://cmfw5qbmfxvnkjxgtpjoabofw.agent.a.smyth.ai/api/generate_event_announcement`
   - Same pattern as email generation
   - 30-second timeout with proper error handling

### 🎨 Frontend Implementation

2. **ClassroomManagement Component Updates**:
   - AI-powered announcement generation (removed mock/template data)
   - Suggestions handling similar to email generator
   - Regeneration functionality with user feedback
   - Professional UI with loading states

3. **New UI Features**:
   - Generate announcement with AI
   - Regenerate with suggestions (like email generator)
   - Proper loading indicators
   - Error handling with user feedback

### 🚀 Key Features

2. **Suggestions System**: Works exactly like the email generator
3. **Regeneration**: Users can provide feedback and regenerate content
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user notifications
